in the reminder website, move time of request coming in from VM to hidden html fields so i can use javascript to 
update time left instead of c#, as otherwise if screen is left open, no dynamic update. much later though, as this is
luxury task, and not core functionality. maybe look up how to do periodic function call in c# razor and implement that 
instead?

links for periodic c# functions, intended to periodically update time left for reminder on screen on razor


migrate getREmainingTime from C# to js, or do above to solve the problem.

add support for daily alarms too, currently all these are one time alams. maybe have a drop down menu to choose
type of menu, and add this as a field to my models and view models.

sort alarms based on time of day (easy, i guess, just linq orderby will do) DONE

i think just migrate from inmemory to EF core  database now. i'll still keep in memory for convinience's sake 
though, to maybe test my code when i'm making small changes
